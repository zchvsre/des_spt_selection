# Validation of the Selection Effect Template with Simulated Mock Catalog

# TODO List

- Abacus simulated data vector: lambda, sz, lensing from dark matter profile
- Buzzard
- Lensing error from Y1 (McClintock error)
- M500c

# Note

- The SPT signal in Abacus is $\xi$ not $\zeta$
- Buzzard has low richness because the resolution
- In Abacus we don't have $\sigma_{M_{wl}}$ and $\alpha{M_{wl}}$

# Question

- How sensitive is our analysis to $\alpha M_{wl}$ and $\sigma M_{wl}$?
